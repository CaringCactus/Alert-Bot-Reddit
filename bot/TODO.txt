Definite Features to Add
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Change '-hide-nsfw' to '-nsfw', so hiding nsfw is default
2. Add ability to use command (subscribe, unsubscribe, etc) inline in the body and
    potentially leave subject/body subs too. Maybe parse the sub and do a toString()
    with sorting and use that as the sub column in the database. Then separate each
    command type into its own file/handler
3. Add functionality to edit the subscription. Example:
    - edit #1 add test1, test2 to item, remove test3, test4
4. Add email functionality
5. Create MESSAGE table in database to handle messages sent to user about subscription. This would
    allow users to reply to a message with a blank subject with "unsubscribe" and the bot would know
    which subscription to unsubscribe from. Fields:
    - Subscription ID
    - Message ID
